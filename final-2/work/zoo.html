                    <h2>Designing a data-driven display</h2>
                    <p>The Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium has received a grant from an 
                        anonymous donor to increase visitors and engagement at the 
                        Zoo in response to 2+ years of pandemic. Restrictions 
                        include having only one screen and a ban on customer interaction. 
                        Completed as a class project for Interaction Design Studio.

            <h2>People are still hesitant to return to the zoo</h2>
            <p>As the pandemic situation improves, people are still hesitant to 
                resume social activities such as visiting zoos. In response to this 
                challenge, the CEO of Pittsburgh Zoo has tasked our team with designing 
                a display that would attract more visitors and boost engagement. 
                Our objective is to minimize wait times and increase interaction with 
                the zoo's popular events. To achieve this, the CEO has identified five 
                distinct stakeholders that the display should address.</p>

                engagement at the Pittsburgh Zoo?”</p>

            <h2>To enter the zoo, you walk into the train…</h2>
            <p>In order to maximize views and increase visitor engagement, 
                we strategically placed our display inside the zoo train. 
                Our display provides information on upcoming stops, including event details, 
                venue capacity, animal names, and sponsors. If users are intrigued by the 
                information, they have the option to get off at the next stop. 
                Additionally, our display includes a preview of the next few stations 
                to keep users informed and interested, allowing customers to plan 
                their next steps.</p>
            <p>To help minimize wait times and keep guests informed, our display 
                also includes venue capacity, density maps, and show schedules. 
                We designed the display with a vibrant and playful aesthetic that 
                aligns with the child-friendly atmosphere of the zoo. While parents 
                read through the information, children can stay entertained with 
                fun animations and animal-to-word matching games.</p>

        <div class="analysis">
            <h2>Narrowing down our focus to 2 primary stakeholders and eliminating unnecessary data</h2>
            <p>Before we could decide how to present the data to our users, we 
                had to first understand it. We asked questions such as “does a 
                user need to know how many shows there are per day at the Aquarium?” 
                or “does the volunteer guest service agent need to know how long it 
                takes for the train to get from station 1 to station 5?” We then 
                mapped available data and metadata to each stakeholder, with a focus 
                on mom and mobility-challenged elderly man customers. This allowed us 
                to narrow our focus and exclude any unnecessary information, ensuring 
                that our product is both comprehensive and effective in addressing our 
                users' needs.</p>

        <div class="design">
            <h2>Our initial idea was confusing and inconsistent</h2>
            <p>Our first prototype consisted of four sections: the train station, 
                zoo map, venue schedule, and venue information. We planned to put it 
                outside the train station for people to view while waiting for the train. 
                However, during a class-wide critique, we realized that our display had 
                the following problems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The design does not match the fun atmosphere of the Zoo</li>
                <li>The four components aren’t cohesive </li>
                <li>It’s ok to focus on certain stakeholders, but some aspects of all 
                    five stakeholder’s needs have to be reflected in the display</li>
                <li>People may forget the display quickly if they can only see it at one train station</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="caption">The animation idea at the time was a train that changed the background image as it moved around the screen</p>
        
            <h2>I pitched that we pivot ideas and change our display location, content, and design</h2>
            <p>Due to being unsatisfied with how well our display was meeting project goals, 
                I proposed a pivot in direction to my team. I presented a re-analysis of our 
                stakeholders’ needs and some preliminary sketches of a new idea that could better 
                address user needs. One key difference was placing the display in the train.</p>

            <h2>I lead a complete rehaul of our design in two days</h2>
            <p>The team agreed to the pivot and I lead the redesign efforts of our new display. 
                We worked in a time crunch as the project presentation was in just two days after the pivot was proposed.</p>
