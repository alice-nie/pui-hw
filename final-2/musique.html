                    <h2> Creating a more informative rental experience</h2>
                    <p>As a store with a strong customer base among its local musicians, 
                        Musique is interested in expanding its reach by establishing an online presence. 
                        Aside from creating a more professional and informative website and app compared 
                        to its competitors, our team focused on designing cross-device interactions 
                        that would streamline the rental process and minimize customer frustrations. 
                        Completed as a class project for Interaction Design Studio.

        <div class="problem">
            <h2>Musicians are wary of buying instruments online</h2>
            <p>While there is an audience that is often busy and would benefit 
                from online rental services, the problem we encountered was that 
                when faced with big-money purchases, customers dislike buying them 
                online without first trying the product to acertain that they like it. 
                We were challenged to identify and create features that would 
                overcome this virtual barrier and expand Musique’s customer base 
                through its online store. </p>

                in-store pick-up experience in order to attract new customers?”</p>

                    <h3>A professional interface welcomes a more mature audience</h3>
                    <p>Musique differentiates itself from other rental sites by 
                        offering an elegant UI that caters to adults, countering 
                        the misconception that only children are learning musical 
                        instruments and that rental instruments are somehow inferior 
                        to purchased ones.</p>

                    <h3>Video and audio provide a more informative experience</h3>
                    <p>Hearing how an instrument sounds before buying it is a crucial 
                        aspect of the purchasing process. At Musique, we aim to replicate 
                        this experience on our platform by providing audio and video samples.</p>
