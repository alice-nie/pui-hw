                    <h2>Organizing the trip with a hovering toolkit</h2>
                    <p>The trip-planning domain is already saturated with applications 
                        trying to help travelers organize their thoughts and make better 
                        decisions. Our team conducted extensive research to identify the 
                        still unmet needs of our users and how we might make a product 
                        that would differentiate us from the market. Completed as a class 
                        project for User-Centered Research Evaluation.

            <h2>Students struggle with planning group trips</h2>
            <p>Organizing a trip can be a time-consuming and challenging task, 
                especially when traveling with a group. It becomes even more difficult 
                when trying to accommodate everyone's individual preferences and requirements. 
                For college students, who often have limited income and experience with travel 
                planning, the process can seem overwhelming.</p>

            <h2>Many factors can cause frustration while planning group trips</h2>
            <p>When starting a project in an unfamiliar problem domain, it was crucial 
                for all team members to gather as much information as possible from 
                existing sources. Our inquiries revolved around topics such as the stakeholders 
                involved, their needs and desires, and the shortcomings of current approaches.</p>
            <p>To begin, we each carried out our own background research through 
                literature reviews and fly-on-the-wall observation of group 
                trip-planning processes and frustrations. Afterward, we collaborated 
                to develop a shared understanding of the problem domain through the 
                "walking the wall" technique.</p>

            <h2>In what ways can we enable students to easily sort, group, and track different resources?</h2>
            <p>We found ourselves overwhelmed with the number of possible needs we 
                found from our initial research. In order to narrow our main research
                 question down, the team conducted a reframing activity with abstract laddering.</p>

            <h2>Students find interpersonal conflict to be the most difficult to deal with</h2>
            <p>To explore our new research question, the team conducted directed storytelling, 
                allowing us to vividly recreate the context, process, and feelings of travel 
                planning for a group without directly observing a group go through the whole 
                process. During this process, our main question was what aspects of the process 
                do students find most frustrating and time-consuming?</p>

            <p>The four themes that emerged from affinity mapping informed the 
                four primary feature flows of our product. These themes were consistently 
                mentioned in all of our interviews, and our users were unable to identify 
                any existing application that addressed all four issues.</p>

            <h2>Five opportunities to streamline trip planning</h2>

                To further consolidate our findings, we created some models to 
                better understand the thought processes and feelings of our users. 
                Combining these findings with the themes from affinity diagraming, 
                we were able to identify five design opportunities.</p>

            <p>After the switch to the desktop application, we finalized our product 
                to be a hovering toolkit with three distinct sections that cover our four 
                flows: smart research, discussion, resources, and travel profiles. 
                We employed our lo-fi prototypes to validate three of the riskiest 
                features of our product. Concerned that students might not be inclined to 
                download a desktop application, we developed a demo and survey to gauge 
                the App Net Promoter Score. Thankfully, it appeared that the benefits 
                of our app exceeded the effort required to download another application. 
                Furthermore, we received favorable feedback for our smart pop-up and 
                drag n' drop features.</p>

        <p>Working with the same team throughout the semester was both a rewarding 
            and challenging experience. As the project manager of the group, 
            I learned how to maintain a flexible mindset and to frequently restate goals, 
            tasks, and takeaways to ensure the team was on the same page. One of 
            my proudest moments during this project was facing my fear of confrontation 
            and talking with a team member individually on ensuring their work met 
            group expectations.</p>

            <p>I also lead the majority of the design process, where I worked to make 
                sure our designs were aligned with project goals. One of my major 
                takeaways from this project was the importance of preparation, communication, 
                and speaking your mind. Only by doing all three was I able to talk with my 
                group about pivotting ideas from a browser plugin to desktop application.</p>
