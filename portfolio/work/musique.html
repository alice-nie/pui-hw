                    <p>As a store with a strong customer base among its local musicians, 
                        Musique is interested in expanding its reach by establishing an online presence. 
                        Aside from creating a more professional and informative website and app compared 
                        to its competitors, our team focused on designing cross-device interactions 
                        that would streamline the rental process and minimize customer frustrations. 
                        Completed as a class project for Interaction Design Studio.

            <p>While there is an audience that is often busy and would benefit 
                from online rental services, the problem we encountered was that 
                when faced with big-money purchases, customers dislike buying them 
                online without first trying the product to acertain that they like it. 
                We were challenged to identify and create features that would 
                overcome this virtual barrier and expand Musique’s customer base

                We specifically targeted students who were picking up a new instrument,
                 which is when customers would typically decide to rent rather than buy. 
                 Additionally, we conducted unobtrusive research on service providers 
                 and business owners through online communities like Reddit, Quora,

            <h2>The competition provided little to no information</h2>
            <p>To better understand the competitive landscape, our team analyzed 
                the websites of other music rental stores. During our analysis, we 
                identified a range of issues across all sites, with the most 
                significant concern being the lack of instrument information available 
                to customers for purchase. Most sites simply offered an image of the 
                instrument along with its name. Additionally, we found that the 
                majority of rental sites were geared toward children who are just 
                starting to learn an instrument.

            <p>To better understand our stakeholders, we synthesized our research 
                findings into personas. During this process, we recognized that 
                trying to cater to all stakeholders on one site would result in 
                a shallow product. Consequently, we focused our efforts primarily 
                on our customers and their unique opportunity areas, which also

            <p>From our critique sessions, we received positive feedback on 
                giving the instrument view a bit of sophistication, drama, and striking visual interest. 
                This evoked imageries of symphonies and concerts, which suited the content of the application.
                To that end, our visual style emphasized dark, dramatic, and striking 
                photos of instruments, paired with a dark, velvety color scheme.</p>
